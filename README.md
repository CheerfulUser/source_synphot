# source_synphot
Compute synthetic photometry of arbitrary sources in arbitrary passbands

Uses pysynphot/synphot_refactor to normalize a source spectrum at some redshift
to an observed magnitude in some passband, and then computes synthetic
photometry of the resulting SED in arbitrary passbands at arbitrary redshifts.

pre-alpha, non-functional at present
